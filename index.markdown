## Mission and Vision of Humble Running

Running is defined as a type of gait, characterized by an aerial phase in which both feet are off the ground for an instant with each step propelling you forward. 
To me, running is so much more than this anatomical description. The reason I initially started running, like most individuals, was because I was out of shape 
and wanted be a little “healthier”. Once I started running, I realized I got a lot more than I bargained for; it became more than just a workout so I can justify
a beer at the end of a long day. I found a community that was accepting to all walks of life that did not care about your experience, the number of miles you 
could run or how fast you could run those miles. 

In most sports you are competing against a team or another individual, but with running you find yourself rooting for the runners next to you in a race and are
only focusing on trying to improve your personal best. This is why I wanted to become a running coach. I wanted to have the opportunity to help athletes realize
and achieve goals they didn’t think were possible. Whether this is your first time lacing up running shoes or you’re a seasoned marathoner, I have the ability 
to create a customized training plan. I am a Certified Running Coach through the United Endurance Sports Coaching Academy (UESCA). My training plans are based
on scientific research and analysis that I learned through the UESCA. 

I take the time to understand your current level of training, past injuries, running gait/form, and goals to deliver a truly customized training plan. Once we
have a foundation in place for your training plan, we will continue to check in weekly to modify and tweak the plan as needed. One of the biggest mistakes athletes
make is following a generic plan that is rigid and does not adapt to how your body and mind are feeling. Life happens and your plan needs to be flexible to account
for any changes such as an injury, a work commitment that pops up or general burnout from all that life throws at you. Training will be challenging at times but
above all I want to make sure you do not lose the love of running. I look forward to the opportunity to help you achieve your running and fitness goals.

Pace be with you,

Coach Vena
